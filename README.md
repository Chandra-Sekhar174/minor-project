 The "Smart Crop Protection System from Animals Using Sensors and Alerts" helps farmers protect their crops from animals in an easy and safe way. It uses sensors to detect
 when animals enter the farm area and immediately sends alerts through sounds, lights, or messages to the farmer. This system reduces the need for manual 
monitoring and prevents crop damage without harming the animals. It is simple, costeffective, and useful for farmers to keep their fields safe and increase their yield.
